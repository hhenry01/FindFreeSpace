# FindFreeSpace

When searching for a study room at UBC, it can be difficult to find one that is empty. Normally, you have to pick a building without knowing if any of the rooms are available! With findfree.space, you can select which building to look at, and then check the vacancy of every room. Alternatively, FFS shows the number of occupants in the room, if you don't mind just a little bit of company.
